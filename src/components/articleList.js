    text: "Agents of Shield was a show that I didn't really want to watch. A show based on the revival of a dead character seemed annoying. I was one of many who thought that Coulson should have stayed dead at the end of Avengers 1. But I went with it. Now a season later, I'm convinced by what they were trying to do. Fun, flashy and full of action, this show really keeps you going. The dialogue can be TOO cheesy, but the secret agent plot and all the moving parts make for great TV.",
