Disney Plus CRUD Blog

I'm a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy, and Disney's Marvel and Star Wars properties have been big favourites. I've been interested in making a project from my hobbies, and since becoming a subscriber this project seemed to take root. This blog is my attempt to clone the interface of Disney +, but with a twist. I've created a blog at the same time.

Built in React and with a focus on visual design, I challenge you to compare this website to Disney + itself. It was made to imitate the brand styling, as thought Disney made it themselves.

With this blog, users can:

- View reviews, articles and top ten lists of Disney + content.
- Create their own articles of Disney + content, using the create review and create top ten tools.
- See an uncanny resemblance to Disney +
