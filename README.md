Disney Plus Blog

I'm a huge fan of Disney Plus and most of Disney's content. I'm a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy, and Disney's Marvel and Star Wars properties have been big favourites. This blog is my attempt to clone the interface of Disney +, but with a twist. I've created a blog at the same time.

Built in React and with a focus on visual design, I challenge you to compare this website to Disney + itself. It won't be identical, but the features will look a lot like it.

With this blog, users can:
- View reviews, articles and top ten lists of Disney + content.
- Create their own articles of Disney + content, using the create review and create top ten tools.
- See an uncanny resemblance to Disney +
